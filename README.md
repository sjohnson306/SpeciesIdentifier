# SpeciesIdentifier
This is an application to identify bird species from images, written in Swift using the Xcode IDE and the CreateML framework.

Samuel Johnson’s capstone project in software engineering at Ferris State University. The machine learning model was trained using the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset:
    
Wah C., Branson S., Welinder P., Perona P., Belongie S. “The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset.” Computation & Neural Systems Technical Report, CNS-TR-2011-001.

In normal use, the user uploads an image of a bird and the application displays to the user the machine learning model's top guess or guesses for the bird's species.
